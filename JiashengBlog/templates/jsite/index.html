            <h2>Thanks</h2>
          </div>
            <p>I want to say thank you to all people who have helped me, regardless of those who help me online with blog, article or those who help me personally.</p>
            <p>I build this website and blog for learning back-end related programming.I can't do this without this tutorial from <a href="https://juejin.im/user/5baf202c5188255c6140db05/posts">dusai</a> and the Django tutorial.Because I only have a basic level of front-end knowledge, So almost all of the front-end related resources are acquired online, most from <a href="https://github.com/sujinleeme/resume-generator">sujinleeme</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ndrewtl/airspace-jekyll">airspace</a>.
            <p>Django community and tutorials are amazing, It's so convient to start learning Django.For deploying my website and blog to AWS, I choose Nginx as server because there are lots of documents online, whenever I got a problem, I can find the solution in time.</p>
